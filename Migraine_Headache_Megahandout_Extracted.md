Migraine Headaches 
Migra
ines afflict about 28 million people in the United Stat es. Up to 6% of all men and 18% of all women (12% 
of the population). Roughly 75% of migraine sufferers are women. Children also get migraine (5-10% of 
children under the ag e of 18 years).  
Most adults will experience a tension-type headache at some time during their lives. Tension-type headaches are 
mild to moderate bilateral pressure or tightening.  The pain is not usually aggravat ed by routine activity and is 
not associated with symptoms such as  nausea and sensitivity to light and noi se.  Tension-type headaches are not 
usually disabling. If you have frequent  tension type headaches it is likely that you are also prone to migraines. 
Many headache specialists believe that  tension headaches and migraine don’t exist as discrete conditions but 
form a continuum of the same entity.  
Many blame their migraines on "sinus headache" due their frontal location.  Patients that present with recurrent 
frontal headaches without infection us ually have migraine.  Sinus headaches  are typically associated with a 
cloudy (not clear) nasal discharge. Sinus problems can act  as a trigger in someone with a predisposition for 
migraine. 
Many people like to divide her headac hes as "stress headaches", "hunger h eadaches" along with her migraines. 
Like the example of the sinus headaches these are pr obably the triggers with underlying condition of the 
migraine being the main problem 
Classification Criteria for Migraine  
A.At least 5 attacks fulfilling criteria B-D below
B.Headache attacks lasting 4-72 hours  (untreated or unsuccessfully treated)
C.Headache has at least two of the following characteristics:
1.unilateral location (Can be bilateral)
2.pulsating quality
3.moderate or severe pain intensity
4.aggravation by or causing avoidan ce of routine phys ical activity ( eg, walking or climbing stairs)
D.During headache at least one of the following:
1.nausea and/or vomiting
2.photophobia and phonophobia
E.Not attributed to another disorder
Migraine is triggered by a cascade of even ts that appear to be sligh tly different in different people. I t is clear 
that migraine is a biological disorder . The brain  of a mi graine patient is thought to be ve ry sensitive to triggers 
and environmental factors. Alth ough it is no t clear where or why it starts, so me patients have a unique pattern of 
activity that spreads across the outer layer s of the brain. This activity is thought to be responsible for the aura 
that about 30% of patients with migraine ex perien ce. The aura can be recognized as flashing lights, blurred 
vision, numbness or tingling.  Some p eople experience vertigo or speech difficulty. The actual pain in  migraine 
is thought to be caused by inflammation around  the blood vessels that surround the outer layers of th e brain. Up 
to 70% of people report persistent symptoms for few hours to days after the headache including sensitivity to 
light, letharg y, fatigue and inability to focus known as the "postdr ome". Likewise, about 60% of people have a 
period of difficulty concentrating, yawning fatigue sens itivity  to lig ht an d noise lastin g a few hours to days 
before the aura and head ache known as the "prodr ome". 
Migraine Facts: 
1.Migraine is a biol ogical disorder.
2.Migraine is a disorder of the central nervous system
3.Migraine represents a hypersensitivity  of the central nervous system to specific triggers  and stimuli.
4.Migraine is genetic
5.There is no “cure” for migraine. While there is no cure we do have appropriate and effective treatment
options.

Headache 	Prevention	
Triggers 	and	Lifestyle		
Whether	or	not	you	take	preventive	medications,	you	may	benefit 	from	 lifestyle	changes	that	can	
help	reduce	the	number	and	sever ity	of	migraines.		Simple	thing s	like	changes	to	a	normal	routine	
can	lead	to	a	severely	disabling	migraine	attack.			
It	may	be	unrealistic	to	expect	 someone	to	completely	change	a	certain	lifestyle.		Certain	things	are	
relatively	easy	to	do.		For	example:		
Maintain 	regular	sleep 	patterns .		Go	to	sleep	and	wake	up	a t	about	the	same	time	each
day.
Eat	regular	meals .		Skipping	meals	and	hunger	can	cause	headaches
Avoid	common 	triggers 	(see	table	on	Common	Triggers)	 such	as	foods,	odors,	and	brigh t
lights.
Limit	stress.		Avoid	conflicts	and	try	to	resolve	disputes	calmly.
Try	to	quit	 smoking. 		Smoking	can	trigger	headach es	or	make	headaches	worse.
Exercise 	regularly .		Aerobic	exercise	for	at	least 	30	minutes	three	times	a	week	 can	help
reduce	frequency	and	severity	of	migraine.		 Warm	up	because	sudden,	intense	exercise	can
trigger	a	headache
Don't	overuse	your 	pain	medications. 		Using	pain	medications	more	than	2	days	per
week	will	cause	analgesic	rebound	headaches
Avoiding 	Triggers 		
"Triggers"	are	specific	factors	that	may	increase	your	risk	of	 having	a	migraine	attack.		 The	
migraine 	sufferer	has	inherited 	a	sensitive 	nervous	system	that	under	certain	circumstances,	can	
lead	to	migraine.		
Triggers	do	not	"cause"	migraine .		Instead,	they	are	thought	to 	activate	processes	that	cause	
migraine	in	people	who	are	prone 	to	the	condition.		A	certain	trigger	will	not	induce	a	migraine	in	
every	person;	and,	in	a	single	m igraine	sufferer,	a	trigger	may 	not	cause	a	migraine	every	time.			
You	may	want	to	keep	a	 headache 	diary	so	that	you	will	be	able	to	ide ntify	some	triggers	for	your	
particular	headaches.	Once	you	have	identified	triggers,	it	wil l	be	easier	for	you	to	avoid	them	and	
reduce	your	chances	of	having	a	migraine	attack.		Stress	and	“Sinus”	headaches 	
Many	people	blame	their	headaches	on	stress	and	sinus	when	they 	are	actually	migraine.		Stress	
and	sinus	problems	can	be	though t	of	as	among	many	of	the	migra ine	triggers.	
Obesity: 	People	who	are	obese	have	5	time s	greater	risk	for	getting	migr aines.	
Depression :	People	with	depression	have	3	times	greater	risk	for	getting	 migraines	
Sleep	apnea:	People	with	poor	sleep	and	sleep 	apnea	have	increased	risk	of	h eadaches	and	
chronic	migraine.

Migraine 	Preventative/Prophylactic 	Medication 	
People with regular or severe migraine attacks may benefit from  taking medications on a 
daily basis to prevent or reduce  their headache frequency.  These medications are called 
prophylactic or preventative medications.  They help reduce your headache sensitivity.  
Another way of thinking about it is that they will raise the th reshold at which you get a 
headache. Prophylactic 	medications 	are	not	a	cure . Abortive, as-needed medication will still 
be necessary almost all patients.   
Traditional migraine medication preventative therapies were ori ginally developed for 
other medical problems.  Through  experience we have found that these medications are 
helpful for migraines. These med ications come from one of 3 maj or categories including 
antihypertensives, anti‐ seizure	medications 	and	antidepressants.   If we prescribe one of 
these medications it	does	not	mean	that	we	feel	that	your	headaches 	are	due	to	hypertension, 	
seizures	 or	depression . 
The newest class of migraine preventative medication is the anti‐ CGRP (calcitonin gene 
related peptide) monoclonal antibodies. These are migraine specific medications given by 
injection. They are touted as potentially reducing headache fre quency by 50% in between 
40-50% of people using them.  Sin ce this is a new medication it  is expensive and insurance
companies may require that you ha ve tried and failed traditiona l therapy. Unlike
tradition
al medications these tend to have a more rapid onset o f action.
Botox  treatments are beneficial for p eople who have chronic migraine s.  You have chronic 
migraines if you're having headaches 15 days or more each month  for 6 months or more. 
Insurance companies require that you have tried and failed at least 2-3 traditional 
therapies. 
Guidelines 
We try to pick a drug with the b est efficacy and the fewest sid e effects
We try to take a drug that is le ast likely to interact with you r other medications.
We initiate the chosen drug at a  low dose and titrate up to an effective dose or until
there are side effects.
Note: It	takes	time	for	traditional 	migraine 	prophylactic 	to	work.		While	you 	may	start
feeling	 benefit	in	2‐3	weeks,	a	2	to	3	month	trial 	is	often	needed	to	assess	the	efficacy	of
a	treatment.
We often try to use a drug that may benefit 
any comorbid or coexisting conditions
the patient has.  For example the  patient has hypertension we w ill use one of the
antihypertensives that is al so beneficial for migraine.
The role of the anti-CGRP medications may change how we prescri be preventative
medications over time

1Rebound Headaches (Medicat ion Overuse Headache) 
Overview 
You feel a headache coming on, so you reach for a pain re liever. Or maybe you take pain medication in advance — 
even every day — to stave off frequent headaches. After all, that's what pain relievers are for, right? 
Think again. 
Pain relievers offer quick relief for occasional headaches. Bu t there's a limit. If you find yourself taking pain medication 
more than two or three days a week , you may actually be contributing to your headaches rather than easing them. 
It's a cycle known as rebound headaches. 
The cycle starts when you take too much headache medica tion.  Soon, your body adapts to the medication and you 
become dependent upon it. You may not even realize that y ou've been dosing yourself t oo often until you miss a day 
and your head starts to hurt again. 
The only way to stop rebound headaches is to reduce or stop taking the pain medication that's causing them.  
Signs and symptoms 
Rebound headaches, also called medication overuse headaches , tend to occur almost every day, sometimes 
waking you in the early morning and continuing throughout  the day. Sometimes, a rebound headache causes dull, 
achy pain. In other cases, the pain is throbbing or pounding.  Other symptoms can include nausea, anxiety, 
depression, memory problems and insomnia.  At times you may have your typical migraine symptoms such as nausea 
and photosensitivity. 
Causes 
Overuse of nearly any pain reliever  can contribute to rebound headaches. But some medications are more likely to 
lead to rebound headaches than are others. 
Simple pain relievers.  Acetaminophen (Tylenol).  Even NSAIDs such as ibuprofen (Motrin) and Napros yn
(Aleve) can contribute to rebound headache s if taken more than 10 days per month
Combination pain relievers are particularly likely to cause rebound.  Over-the-counter pain relieve rs that
contain a combination of caffeine, aspirin and acet aminophen (Excedrin, others) are common culp rits.
Prescription medications containing the sedative butalbital , acetaminophen and caffeine such as
Fioricet, Fiorinal and Esgic are extremely likely to cause rebound and are highly addictive .
Migraine medications.   Overuse of migraine medications including ergotamines and triptans such as
sumatriptan, Imitrex, Treximet, Maxalt and Rel pax.
Opiates.  Painkillers derived from opium or from synt hetic opium compounds include combin ations of
codeine and acetaminophen (Tylenol with Codeine No. 3 and No. 4, others).
Caffeine ; from your morning coffee, your afternoon soda, or  any pain reliever or other product containing
this mild st imulant.
Ho
w Much Medication Is Too Much ? 
For an episodic migraine condition to transform into a chronic one, medications need to be taken for only a modest 
number of days per month: 5 to 10, depending on the type of medication. 
A pivotal study found that butalbital  combinations were most likely to cause medication overuse head ache,
needi
ng to be taken on merely 5 or more days per month .
Opioids  ca
used it if taken 8 or more days per month .
Triptan
s if taken 10 or more days per month .
Nons
teroidal anti-inflammatory drugs  (NSAIDs) actually protected against transformatio n to daily
head
ache if used 5 or fewer days per month , but caused medication overuse headache if used 10 or mo re
days pe
r month.
Thus, there was a hierarchy of risk, with butalbital being the worst, opioids in the middle, and NSAIDs a nd
triptans the least risky.  Excedrin (aspirin and acetaminophen and caffeine) was not included in this study bu t
is frequently overused and is a common cause of rebound headaches.

2Risk factors 
Anyone who has a history of migraine headach es,
People with a of history of obesity, depression,  anxiety, smoking, physi cal inactivity and chronic GI and or
musculoskeletal complain ts
Complications 
Drug dependency may be a risk of any drug that results in rebound headaches. Excessive use of some types of pain 
medication also may cause stomach ulcers, liver damage and kidney problems. 
Treatment 
To break the cycle of rebound headaches, you'll need to re strict how much pain medication you use. Depending on 
what drug you've been taking, your doctor may recommend stopping the medication right away or gradually reducing 
the dose until you're taking the drug no more than twice a week . 
Stopping pain medication isn't easy. Expect your headaches to get worse before they get better. You also may 
experience withdrawal symptoms such as nervousness, re stlessness, nausea, vomiting, insomnia, abdominal pain, 
and diarrhea or constipation. But it doesn't last forever. Wi thin a week to 10 days, your  headaches may become less 
intense and happen less often. With perseverance, most  people break the rebound headache cycle within two 
months. You may need a bridging medication , something to help alleviate headache pain and the side effects 
associated with drug withdrawal. Prednisone is often very effective. 
Before or during withdrawal, you will need to begin a daily preventive medication , such as: 
An antidepressant such as amitriptyline or nortriptyline (Elavil and Pamelor)
An anticonvulsant such as topiramate (Topamax), zonisamide (Zonegran) or valproic acid (Depa kote)
A blood pressure medication such as propranolol, metoprol ol or verapamil.
Botox injections can be used if mult iple oral medications ha ve failed.
Prevention  
Avoid migraine triggers.
Keep a headache diary.  If you're not sure what triggers your headaches, keep a headache diar y. Include
details about every headache. When did it start? What were you doing at the tim e? Wh at did you eat that
day? How did you sleep the night before?  What's your stress level? How l ong did it last? What, if anything,
provided relief? Eventually, you may begin to see a patte rn — and take steps to prevent future headache s.
Get enough sleep.  Go to bed and wake up at the same time every day — even on weekends. If you're no t
tired at bedtime, don't fight it. Read or watch television until you become drowsy and fall asle ep naturally.
Don't skip meals.  Start your day with a healthy breakfast. Ea t lunch and dinner at about the same time
every day. Avoid any foods that seem to trigger headaches .
Exercise regularly.  Physical activity causes y our body to release chemicals that block pain signal s to your
brain. With your doctor's OK, choose activities you enj oy — such as walking, swimming or cycling.  Always
start slowly by warming up and then cool dow n to prevent exercise-induced headache s.
Reduce stress.  Get organized. Simplify your schedule. Plan ahead. When the going gets to ugh, stay
positive.
Relax.  Try yoga, meditation or relaxation exercises. Se t aside time to slow down. Listen to musi c, read a
book or take a hot bath.
Quit smoking . Smoking can trigger headaches or make them wo rse.
Lose weight.  Recent data suggests that obesity is linked to chronic migraine.
